/* 
 * Access Token
 * 
 * Access Token is a string value creditential used to
 * access the resource server, which is the server that
 * host resource owner (user) data (resource).
 *
 * An Access Token is a hashed string value that has
 * been issued by the authorisation server in exchange
 * for the authorisation code (authorisation grant).
 *
 * So, using the Authorisation-Code flow, the resource
 * -owner logs-in, onto the Authorisation-Server, which
 * returns the Authorisation-Code.
 * The client then exchanges the Authorisation-Code for
 * the Access-Code, which is then used to access the
 * resource.
 *
 * The Access Token contains information such as an ind-
 * entifier, scope, expiry date etc.

/*
 * Refresh Token
 * 
 * Refresh Token are creditentials, which are used to get
 * a new Access-Token, when the previous one expires
