/*
     * Authorisation Grant represents the credentials, which is used
     * by the client to access the resource data from the resource
     * server.
     * 
     * There are four types of Authorisation Grant:
     * + Authorisation Code
     * + Implicit
     * + Resource Owner Password Credentials
     * + Client Credentials
     * 
     * */

    /*
     * Authorisation Code
     * 
     * The Authorisation Code is a token, which is generated by the
     * authorisation server (the login platform) after the resource
     * owner (the account holder) enters their login credentials.
     * 
     * Using the Authorisation Code, the client application/server
     * uses the Authentication Code to get the Access Token, which is
     * used to access the resouce server.
     * 
     * Authorisation code tends to be a hashed token, which contains
     * temporary information about the session. It never holds the
     * resource owners login credentials.
     * 
     * */

    /*
     * Implicit
     * 
     * Implicit is similar to the Authorisation Code flow, except the
     * authorisation server returns the Access Code, instead of the
     * Authorisation Code.
     * 
     * Using implicit, it removes the need recontact the authorisation
     * server to exchange the Authorisation Code for the Access Code.
     * 
     * */

    /*
     * Resource Owner Password Credentials
     * 
     * Resource Owner Password Credentials flow abandons the use of
     * hashed Access Code, and instead uses Resource Owners credentials
     * i.e. username and password to directly access the resource
     * server.
     * 
     * Here the application literally hold the Resource owners username
     * and password.
     * 
     * Note:: This appraoch when application is secure and higly
     * trusted to access the resource server on your behalf.
     * 
     * */

    /*
     * Client Credential
     * 
     * Client Credentials are used as an authorization grant typically
     * when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also
     * the resource owner).
